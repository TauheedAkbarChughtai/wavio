## How to install

For now you can only install the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/Joel-Mercier/wavio/releases).

Two versions are available for 64bit (arm64-v8a) and 32bit (armeabi-v7a) architectures. If in doubt try arm64-v8a first. Simulator architectures (x86, x86_64) are not provided.

We are nearing a official release on the Google Play Store ! Production access request has been submitted. 

### Use Android Auto with a APK install

Android Auto doesn't detect Wavio automatically if you installed the app via APK on Github, Android Auto detects only Play Store apps automatically. To see Wavio with a APK install on Android Auto : 

1. On the phone, open Android Auto settings  (Settings → Connected devices → Android Auto, or open the standalone Android Auto app's settings,  varies by phone).
2. Scroll to the bottom and tap "Version" ~10 times until it says developer mode is enabled.
3. Tap the ⋮ overflow menu (top right) → Developer settings.
4. Turn on "Unknown sources" (sometimes worded "Add new apps to launcher" or "Unknown sources").
5. Reconnect the phone to the car (unplug/replug, or restart the Android Auto session).
6. If it still doesn't show, check Customize launcher in Android Auto settings and make sure Wavio is  enabled/checked.

## Development

This repository is a [Bun workspace](https://bun.sh/docs/pm/workspaces) monorepo with two workspaces:

- `apps/mobile` — the Expo mobile app
- `apps/landing` — the [Astro](https://astro.build/) marketing website

A single `bun install` at the repo root installs both. Most scripts are exposed at the root as `mobile:*` / `landing:*` (which delegate to the relevant workspace), or you can run a workspace's own scripts with `bun run --cwd apps/<workspace> <script>`.

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have Node v22+ installed
3. Make sure you have bun installed
4. Install dependencies with `bun install` (from the repo root)
5. Set environment variables in EAS secrets (see `.env.example`)
6. Prebuild the native development app with `bun run mobile:prebuild`
7. Run the app with `bun run mobile:start` and make sure you have a development build for the targetted platform (`bun run mobile:android` or `bun run mobile:ios`)

### Android

1. Make sure you have the correct environnement for building on Android (Android Studio, SDK, Java, etc.)
2. Make sure you are have the SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN and are logged in to the sentry-cli with `sentry-cli login`
3. Make sure you are logged in to Expo with `eas login` (check with `eas whoami`)
4. Build the app with the desired profile `bun run mobile:build:android:<profile>`
5. Install the app on your device with the generated APK file

#### Android Auto

In order to test Android Auto, you need to :
1. Install the Android Auto Desktop Head Unit Emulator via Android Studio in SDK Manager > SDK Tools > Android Auto Desktop Head Unit Emulator.
2. Make sure to enable the developer mode in your devices Android Auto settings by tapping the version number 10 times.
3. Run the head unit server in the Android Auto settings
4. On your development machine, run `adb forward tcp:5277 tcp:5277` and start the emulator with `~/Library/Android/sdk/extras/google/auto/desktop-head-unit`
5. Enable `Unknown sources` in Android Auto's developer settings (⋮ menu > Developer settings > Unknown sources) if the app doesn't show up in the emulator
6. You can check the logs related to the android auto service with `adb logcat -c && adb logcat ReactNativeJS:V CarAuto:V "*:S"`

### iOS

Mostly functional, no carplay or widgets support yet. No plan yet to publish to the App Store.

### Marketing website (`apps/landing`)

The landing page is a static [Astro](https://astro.build/) site (Tailwind v4, `en`/`fr` i18n), independent from the mobile app.

1. Install dependencies with `bun install` (from the repo root, shared with the app)
2. Start the local dev server with `bun run landing:dev` (defaults to `localhost:4321`)
3. Build the production site with `bun run landing:build` (output to `apps/landing/dist/`)
4. Preview the built site with `bun run landing:preview`

For Astro CLI commands, run them inside the workspace: `cd apps/landing && bun run astro ...`.

### E2E tests

The mobile app has E2E tests that are powered by [Maestro](https://docs.maestro.dev/).
To run the tests, you need to have the [Maestro CLI installed](https://docs.maestro.dev/maestro-cli/how-to-install-maestro-cli) and need access to a iOS or Android simulator.
The test scenarios are defined in `apps/mobile/maestro/flows`. Each flow is a sequence of steps that are executed in order.
To run the tests, run `maestro test apps/mobile/maestro/` from the repo root.
You can find more information about the test scenarios in the [E2E tests README](apps/mobile/maestro/README.md).
